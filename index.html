          <h3>Digital Art And Design</h3>
          <p>Drawing has been my passion for the past 4 years. I started drawing to compete with a friend back in highschool, who was far too amazing at what she did. After a while I couldn't help being inspired and creating anything digitally. I love to make all my assets and designs. I draw in Clip Studio Paint and recently started using a Wacom Cintiq 13.</p>

          <h3>Programming</h3>
          <p>I started learning how to code to develop a small pacman clone for a computer science course in college, since then I've been trying to branch into other languages and skillsets. I've been learning C# and python for 2 years, and recently started learning HTML,CSS and JS to branch into web design.</p>
